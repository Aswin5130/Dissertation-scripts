# Install Nessus on Kali Linux (if it's not installed already)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nessus -y

# Start the Nessus service
sudo systemctl start nessusd

# Enable Nessus to start automatically on boot
sudo systemctl enable nessusd

# Open the Nessus web interface by navigating to the following URL in a web browser:
# https://localhost:8834

# After accessing the web interface, log in to Nessus using the credentials you created.

# Run a Nessus scan on the DVWA target (http://192.168.0.38)
# To start a scan from the web interface:
# 1. Select 'New Scan' in the Nessus interface.
# 2. Choose a scan template, e.g., 'Basic Network Scan'.
# 3. Enter the target IP (e.g., 192.168.0.38) in the 'Targets' field.
# 4. Click 'Save' and then 'Launch' to start the scan.

# Alternatively, you can use the Nessus CLI to run a scan, though it requires proper configuration.
# Example CLI command (assuming you have created a scan):
sudo /opt/nessus/sbin/nessuscli scan start --scan <scan_id>

# Once the scan is completed, the Nessus interface will provide you with detailed results, including:
# - Vulnerabilities found
# - Misconfigurations
# - Exploitable issues
# - Outdated software

# You can also export the scan results as an HTML or PDF report:
# In the Nessus web interface, go to 'Scans', click on your scan, and select 'Export'.

# Downloading the results in CLI can also be done using the following command (after scan completion):
# Example:
sudo /opt/nessus/sbin/nessuscli report download --report <report_id> --format html --output /path/to/report.html
